# Education Longitudinal Study

## Introduction
This is A machine learning project on data collected in the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002).

## Overview of the Data Set
The data set is called “Education Longitudinal Study of 2002”. This data set was taken from the website of the National Center for Educational Statics at the following URL: [data set](https://nces.ed.gov/OnlineCodebook/Session/Codebook/e9709488-a3fc-4315-9852-20913485b0d1)

The Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) used surveys of students, their parents, math and English teachers, and school administrators to track the educational and developmental experiences of a nationally representative sample of United States high school students who were 10th graders in the spring of 2002. The students were followed throughout secondary and postsecondary years. The ELS:2002 includes data collected in six data collection waves: Base Year (2002), First Follow-up (2004), High School Transcripts (2005), Second Follow-up (2006), Third Follow-up (2012), and Postsecondary Transcripts (2013). The focus of this study was to identify students' trajectories from the beginning of high school into postsecondary education, the workforce, and beyond, and to identify the different patterns of college access and persistence that occur in the years following high school completion.

## Project Goal
The focus of ELS:2002 study was to answer the following two questions:

* What are students' trajectories from the beginning of high school into postsecondary education, the workforce, and beyond?
* What are the different patterns of college access and persistence that occur in the years following high school completion?

The goal of our machine learning project will align with the focus of this study, and we will try to analyze what the most important factors that influence the postsecondary educational achievements of the students are, and how those factors helped shape a student’s educational achievements.
